# Adso

Adso of Melk is a fictional character from Umberto Eco's novel "The Name of the Rose." He serves as the narrator of the story, recounting the events that occur at a Benedictine monastery in Italy during the 14th century. As William of Baskerville's assistant and scribe, he provides insights into the various mysteries and theological debates that unfold within the monastery.

This is sort-of my experiment trying to make something that can help me through the Labyrinth of everyday work life. A bespoke assistant of sorts.
